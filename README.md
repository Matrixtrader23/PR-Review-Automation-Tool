# PR-Review-Automation-Tool
This project is an automated GitHub Pull Request (PR) review system built as part of a DevOps Internship Assessment.  The tool automatically reviews GitHub Pull Requests, applies branch-based contextual rules, generates structured feedback, and routes the review to an instructor for approval or rejection via a web dashboard.
